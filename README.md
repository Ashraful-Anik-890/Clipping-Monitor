# Enterprise Clipping Monitor

A secure, enterprise-grade user activity monitoring agent for Windows. This application monitors clipboard usage, application activity, browser history, and keystrokes for compliance and productivity tracking.

## 🚀 Features

### Core Monitoring
- **Clipboard Monitoring**: Tracks copy/paste operations (text and images).
- **Application Usage**: Logs active window titles and duration.
- **Browser Activity**: Monitors visited websites (Chrome, Edge, Firefox).
- **Keystroke Logging**: Securely records keystrokes (Admin access only, disabled by default).

### Security & Privacy
- **Encryption**: All sensitive data is encrypted using Fernet (AES).
- **Admin Authentication**: Secure login system with PBKDF2 password hashing.
- **UAC Elevation**: Requires administrator privileges for service management.
- **Service Protection**: Runs as a Windows Service (SYSTEM privileges).
- **Centralized Path Management**: Environment-aware paths using %PROGRAMDATA%.

### Administrator Console
- **Service Control**: Install, Start, Stop, and Remove the monitoring service.
- **Statistics**: Real-time stats on recording status and storage usage.
- **Export Data**: Export logs to JSON or CSV (Encrypted/Decrypted).
- **Data Security**: Secure "First-Run" password setup system.

### Architecture Improvements
- **Modular Design**: Each monitor can be enabled/disabled independently via configuration.
- **Graceful Degradation**: Service continues running even if individual monitors fail.
- **Centralized Configuration**: Single source of truth for all settings.
- **Health Monitoring**: Automatic restart of failed monitors.

cd Clipping-Monitor
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
# Install runtime dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# For development/building (optional)
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

### 3. Verify Installation
```bash

## 🛠️ Usage

### 1. First-Time Setup

#### Option A: Run from Source (Development)
```bash
# Run the Admin Console
python src/enterprise/admin_console.py
```

#### Option B: Build Executable (Production)
```bash
# Build the executables
python build_deployment.py --all

# Executables will be in: dist/EnterpriseMonitoringAgent/
```

### 2. Admin Console Setup
1. **First Run**: You will be prompted to create an Administrator Password.
2. **Login**: Use your newly created password to access the console.
3. **Configure**: Review and adjust settings in the configuration file if needed.

### 3. Setting up the Service
1. Go to the **Service Control** tab in Admin Console.
2. Click **"Install Service"** (Blue Button).
   - *Service will be installed with auto-start configuration*
3. Click **"Start Service"** (Green Button).
   - *Status should change to "Running"*

### 4. Monitoring & Exporting
- The service runs in the background continuously.
- Use the **Admin Console** to:
  - View statistics
  - Export collected data
  - Control the service
- **Warning**: Decrypted exports contain sensitive plain-text data.

## ⚙️ Configuration

Configuration file location: `%USERPROFILE%\.clipboard_monitor\config.json`

### Key Settings

```json
{
  "monitoring": {
    "clipboard": true,
    "applications": true,
    "browser": true,
    "keystrokes": false,
    "screen_recording": false
  },
  "keystrokes": {
    "enabled": false,
    "encryption_enabled": true,
    "buffer_flush_interval": 60,
    "retention_days": 30
  },
  "storage": {
    "encryption_enabled": true,
    "retention_days": 90
  }
}
```

### Enabling/Disabling Monitors

Edit the config file to enable or disable specific monitors:
- Set `"keystrokes": true` to enable keystroke logging
- Set `"screen_recording": true` to enable screen recording
- Restart the service for changes to take effect

## 🔒 Security Considerations

1. **Encryption**: All sensitive data is encrypted at rest using AES (Fernet).
2. **Admin Only**: Service requires SYSTEM privileges; console requires administrator.
3. **Local Storage**: Currently stores all data locally (no network transmission).
4. **Keystroke Logging**: Disabled by default; requires explicit configuration.
5. **Key Management**: Encryption keys stored with restricted file permissions.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Service Won't Start

**Problem**: Service fails to start or crashes immediately.

**Solutions**:
1. Run verification script: `python verify_installation.py`
2. Check service logs: `C:\ProgramData\EnterpriseMonitoring\logs\service.log`
3. Ensure all dependencies installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Verify admin privileges
5. Check Windows Event Viewer for service errors

### Import Errors

**Problem**: `ModuleNotFoundError` or `ImportError`

**Solutions**:
1. Ensure running correct Python version: `python --version` (must be 3.8+)
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. On Windows, ensure pywin32 installed: `pip install pywin32`
4. Run post-install for pywin32: `python -m win32com.client.Makefile -i`

### Path-Related Errors

**Problem**: "Path not found" or directory errors

**Solutions**:
1. All paths now use environment variables automatically
2. Check ProgramData directory exists: `C:\ProgramData\EnterpriseMonitoring\`
3. Ensure write permissions to ProgramData
4. Run Admin Console as Administrator

### Configuration Issues

**Problem**: Service starts but monitors don't work

**Solutions**:
1. Check config file: `%USERPROFILE%\.clipboard_monitor\config.json`
2. Verify monitors are enabled in config
3. Check individual monitor logs
4. Ensure no conflicting software (e.g., other clipboard managers)
